## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in html and css. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch. Since this prject was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the broken navbar. And assistance with flexbox.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i meeded to work on.

## Hardest Sections & Lessons Learnt

The navbar was particularly difficult because i had not leartn flexbox yet therefore i relied on floats to move my navigation content. This seemed like a good resolution until the navigation links started getting kicked out of the header section. A fix to this was to make sure the nav links were structured before the logo in html.

### Working Solution
The above solution was only temporary and it didn't work as well as i wanted it to so i went on to learn flexbox so i can find a fix for it

## Additional Challenges
Styling the forms has been very difficult because i had recently started learning flex. Therefore it took me long to learn the parent-child method in flex. I am still not an expert at flex, however, i can execute flex better than i did in this project. I will not try to fix or change the way i solved it in this project. The reason being i would like to look back at this code one day and see the growth i had.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% through. With that being said, it has also been my favourite project so far because i did not rely fully on tutorials to complete it. I only used tutorials to understand smaller concepts and not full sections.
