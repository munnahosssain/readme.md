## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in html and css. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch. Since this prject was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the broken navbar. And assistance with flexbox.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i meeded to work on.
